 # The Yayagram as a bot

 # Intro
 Hello! I'm Manu ([@mrcatacroquer](https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer)), the guy who created the first Yayagram, A machine that helps our beloved elders to keep communicating with their grandchildren. Here I share with you the code to create a Yayagram as a bot without using a real phone number.

 If you want to support my work and allow me to keep building crazy contraptions please consider buying me a pizza.

 # Things you can do to help

 * The printer is not able to print á,é,í,ó,ú,ñ symbols... I believe the charset can be changed but I didn't spend time on it. That's why there's a "clean" funcion to remove those chars.
 * The printer prints a strange header with the following symbols "x(J", it would be great to remove it.
 * Be bold! And share your changes with pull requests, I would love to see what you can do.
